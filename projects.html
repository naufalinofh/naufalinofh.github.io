                                <p class="project-pitch">Compact and easily deployable unmanned aircraft which is suitable for operations in difficult terrain in short amount of time. It is the first in Indonesia and we are one of the first who successfully built tube launched UAV in the world. The UAV is stored in a tube so it is easy to transport, and we can launch multiple aircraft almost simultaneously without runway needed. We also built coordinated relay system, so we can control multiple UAVs and extend the communication range. </p>

                                    <p><strong>Story</strong> : There are several problems on current UAV
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Transporting UAV require large space</li>
                                            <li>Launching UAV need a runway or a launching gear which need to be installed and uninstalled on site</li>
                                            <li>Limited range of communication, especially in terrain with many obstacles like hills</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <br>
                                        Our team built tube launched folding wing UAV with coordinated relay system to solve above problems. THe UAV can be stored in a tube which make it easy to carry and transport. The pneumatic launch system which integrated with the tube make it easy to deploy it with less effort to install and launch it. Furthermore, coordinate relay system multiply range of communication by deploying multiple UAV and each of them communicate with each other.

                                    <p><strong>Story</strong> : Coral reef destruction can harm ocean ecosystem and humanity as well. We need scalable way to identify coral reef condition and monitor any conservation that we have made. But it is costly to let people monitor to the site directly and measure the condition of coral reef. Unmanned vehicle is the solution. We need unmanned undewater vehicle that can monitor in relatively shallow sea, can cover wide area, low energy and also cheap to manufacture. 
                                        We built LOCAV (Low cost underwater vehicle) for this purpose. We built the body using PVC pipe which is really affordable. We use single motor as thruster and for manovuering, we utlize the fin, rudder and buoyant system for floating. With a single motor, this vehicle is energy efficient compare to ROV (remotely operated vehicle) which usually have multiple motors to move.

                                <p class="project-pitch">Endurance (duration of flight) and maneuverability (how easy it can maneuver) are two of important specification on aircraft which usually on opposite spectrum. For use case like logistic delivery in remote area with difficult terrains, or urban cities where there are numerous tall buidling, both of endurance and maneuverability are crucial. Hybrid VTOL UAV is perfect solution for those use cases.</p>
                                <div id="project-gatotkacaganesha" class="panel-collapse collapse project-detail">
                                    <p><strong>Story</strong> : There are 2 main types of aircraft : 1) Rotary wing : Usually has multi rotors. It can give high maneuver but with low endurance and not energy efficient. 2) Fixed wing : High endurance, can fly for long time and long range, but with low maneuver and need runway for takeoff and landing. We combine fixed wing endurance and multirotors maneuverability by building <strong>Hybrid VTOL UAV</strong>, named Gatotkaca Ganesha.
                                        This unmanned aircraft can take-off and land in small area in quad mode. After gaining altitude, it will transition to fixed wing mode and continue cruising.
